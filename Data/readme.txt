Columns description:
1. reef_name: the name of reefs
2. transectID: the transect number per reef (typically 3 transects per reef)
3. stid: sub-transect (100m2 long) within transect 
4. lng: longitude of the central position of each sub-transect 
5. lat: latitude of the central position of each sub-transect
6. year: sampling year (not used in the model) 
7. ita.bleach.bin: binary indicator of impacts associated to the tropical cyclone Ita and marine heat wave. 1 means that the associated sub-transect was impacted by Ita
8. ita.nathan.bleach.bin: binary indicatior of impacts associated to the two cyclones and marine heat wave.
